# Web3Vote

The repository is the project for completing the Digital Systems and Media course at the Federal University of Cear√°. It deals with a platform for conducting ballots from a decentralized blockchain-based system.

## Installation

Use NPM to install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

The repository uses the addresses of the smart contracts involved in carrying out operations (creating a new Ballot, voting on a proposal for a given Ballot...). You need to update the link when there are changes to these agreements.

To view the user interfaces:

```bash
npm run dev
```
